## 🗡️ **Offensive Strategies**

### Example 1: Aggressive Flanking
```
Create a strategy where units circle around enemies and attack from behind. 
Prioritize attacking enemies with their backs turned. Move in a clockwise 
pattern around the battlefield.
```

### Example 2: Focus Fire
```
All units should target the same enemy until it's eliminated, then move to 
the next target. Prioritize enemies with lowest HP. Coordinate attacks to 
overwhelm single targets.
```

### Example 3: Berserker Mode
```
When HP drops below 30%, go into berserker mode - attack the nearest enemy 
regardless of range or positioning. Above 30% HP, use normal aggressive tactics.
```

---

## 🛡️ **Defensive Strategies**

### Example 4: Turtle Defense
```
Form a tight defensive formation near starting position. Never venture more 
than 3 tiles away from home base. Only attack enemies that come within range. 
Prioritize protecting weaker units.
```

### Example 5: Fortress Hold
```
Move to the nearest fortress terrain and hold that position. Only leave if 
HP is critical. Attack any enemy within range, but never chase them.
```

### Example 6: Retreat and Regroup
```
When any allied unit's HP drops below 50%, all units should retreat to the 
nearest mountain terrain. Regroup and then counter-attack together once healed 
above 60% HP.
```

## ⚖️ **Tactical Strategies**

### Example 7: Divide and Conquer
```
Split forces into two groups. One group attacks from the north, another from 
the south. Target isolated enemies first. Avoid getting surrounded.
```

### Example 8: Bait and Switch
```
Send one unit forward as bait to lure enemies. Once enemies engage, have other 
units flank from the sides. The bait unit should retreat to allies after 
drawing attention.
```

### Example 9: Guerrilla Warfare
```
Never stay in the same position for more than 2 turns. Hit weakest enemy, 
then immediately move to a new position. Use forests and terrain for cover. 
Avoid direct confrontation.
```

---

## 🎯 **Specialized Strategies**

### Example 10: Sniper Support
```
Keep snipers at maximum range at all times. Other units form a protective 
barrier in front. Snipers target enemy snipers first, then other ranged units. 
Melee units protect the snipers.
```

### Example 11: Drone Scout
```
Use drones to scout ahead and identify enemy positions. Drones should not 
engage in combat. Once enemies are spotted, main forces should attack the 
weakest group first.
```

### Example 12: Tank Vanguard
```
Tanks advance slowly in front while other units follow 2-3 tiles behind. 
Tanks absorb damage while allies attack from safe distance. If a tank's HP 
drops below 40%, rotate it to the back.
```

---

## 🏔️ **Terrain-Based Strategies**

### Example 13: High Ground Dominance
```
Immediately rush to capture all mountain and fortress terrain. Hold these 
positions and attack any enemy that approaches. Never leave advantageous 
terrain unless necessary.
```

### Example 14: Water Control
```
Position units near water to slow down enemies. Kite enemies into water 
terrain, then attack while they're slowed. Avoid water yourself unless 
you have drones.
```

### Example 15: Road Rush
```
Use road terrain to move quickly across the battlefield. Avoid slow terrain 
like water and swamp. Prioritize speed over defensive bonuses. Strike fast 
and hard.
```

---

## 🔥 **Advanced Combinations**

### Example 16: Adaptive Response
```
If outnumbered, play defensive and hold fortress positions. If equal numbers, 
play balanced with medium aggression. If outnumbering enemy, go full aggressive 
and rush.
```

### Example 17: Counter-Strategy
```
Identify enemy unit types and counter them: Use snipers against their tanks, 
use fast units against their snipers, use tanks against their soldiers. 
Always target unit type you counter.
```

### Example 18: Formation Warfare
```
Maintain a triangle formation: tanks at front vertex, archers/snipers at 
back corners, soldiers in the middle. Formation should move as one unit. 
If formation breaks, regroup before attacking.
```

### Example 19: Resource Denial
```
Control all advantageous terrain (mountains, fortresses, roads). Deny enemy 
access to these positions. Fight for terrain control first, then engage 
enemies once you control key positions.
```

### Example 20: Psychological Warfare
```
Make unpredictable movements - sometimes aggressive, sometimes defensive. 
Change tactics every 10 turns. Keep enemy guessing. Never establish a 
predictable pattern.
```

## 🎮 **Fun & Creative Strategies**

### Example 21: Dance Around
```
Move in circular patterns around enemies, like a dance. Attack when at optimal 
range, dodge when too close. Never move in straight lines.
```

### Example 22: Pack Hunting
```
Never let units fight alone. Always ensure at least 2 allies are within 3 
tiles of each unit. Attack in packs of 3 or more. Lone units should retreat 
to the pack.
```

### Example 23: Kamikaze Drones
```
Drones should rush enemies at full speed and attack recklessly. Other units 
play defensively. Drones are expendable scouts that create chaos.
```

## 💡 **Tips for Writing Custom Prompts**

### ✅ **Good Prompts:**
- Be specific about actions ("attack from behind" vs "be strategic")
- Include HP thresholds ("when HP < 50%")
- Specify terrain preferences ("use mountains for defense")
- Define unit roles ("tanks in front, snipers in back")
- Set clear conditions ("if outnumbered, then retreat")

### ❌ **Avoid:**
- Vague descriptions ("be smart", "play well")
- Contradictory instructions ("always attack AND always defend")
- Impossible conditions ("never take damage")
- Overly complex multi-paragraph explanations

### 📝 **Structure Tips:**
```
1. Main Strategy (1-2 sentences)
2. Movement Pattern (1 sentence)
3. Attack Conditions (1 sentence)
4. Retreat Conditions (1 sentence)
5. Special Rules (optional)
```

## 🚀 **Test Your Strategy**

After generating code from your custom prompt:
1. ✅ Read through the generated code
2. ✅ Test in a small battle (5v5)
3. ✅ Observe if units follow your strategy
4. ✅ Refine your prompt if needed
5. ✅ Scale up to larger battles

---

## 🎯 **Example: Perfect Prompt**

```
Create a defensive strategy where tanks form a wall at the front, 
soldiers stay 2 tiles behind tanks, and archers attack from 3 tiles back. 

When any unit's HP drops below 40%, it should retreat to the nearest 
mountain or fortress terrain. 

If enemies break through the tank wall, soldiers should counter-attack 
to push them back. 

Archers should always target enemy archers first, then drones, then 
other units.
```

This generates well-structured code that's easy to understand and effective! ✨
